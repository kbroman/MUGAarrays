column,description
marker,Name of SNP marker
chr,Chromosome
bp_mm10,Physical position in basepairs for mm10 mouse genome build
bp_grcm39,Physical position in basepairs for GRCm39 mouse genome build
cM_cox,Average cM position on Cox et al. map (female position on X chromosome)
strand,Strand (plus/minus) from which the probe sequence was taken
snp,SNP alleles as a two-character string
unique,TRUE indicates that the probe sequence appears exactly once in GRCm39 mouse genome build
unmapped,TRUE indicates that the probe sequence has no perfect match in GRCm39 mouse genome build
probe,Probe sequence (49 or 50 bases); the SNP occurs immediately after
strand_flipped,TRUE if the SNP alleles are on the opposite strand from the probe sequence
